  \begin{abstract}
      The goal of this project was to formalise and implement alternative models of computation inside the proof assistant Isabelle,
      and then to make use of this to assist in providing definitions on and proving various results about these models.
      In particular it focuses on Cellular Automata,
      in both one and two-dimensional variants, and with differing topologies.
