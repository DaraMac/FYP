    abstract="We formalise results from computability theory in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Following the textbook by Boolos et al, we formalise Turing machines and relate them to abacus machines and recursive functions. We ``tie the know'' between these three computational models by formalising a universal function and obtaining from it a universal Turing machine by our verified translation from recursive functions to abacus programs and from abacus programs to Turing machine programs. Hoare-style reasoning techniques allow us to reason about concrete Turing machine and abacus programs.",
