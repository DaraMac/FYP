\chapter{Introduction}

Software and proof verification is an interesting and emerging field.


\section{Topic addressed in this project}

We look at formalising models of computation to help deal with the complexity that comes with trying to mathematically prove results about them.


\section{Motivation}

It is very difficult to work with high level concepts while still being rigorous.
Theoretical Computer Science is a very abstract and mathematical discipline at its core and this requires the same level of rigour in dealing with its complex models.
